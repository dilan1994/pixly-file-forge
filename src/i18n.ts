      "support.faq.converter.title": "About Our Image Converter",
      "support.faq.converter.q1": "Why don't my files upload to your servers?",
      "support.faq.converter.a1": "That's by design! Our converter processes everything directly in your browser for maximum privacy. Your files never leave your device, which means faster conversions and complete confidentiality.",
      "support.faq.converter.q2": "Can I use this tool offline?",
      "support.faq.converter.a2": "Yes! Once our page loads, you can convert images even without an internet connection. Your browser handles all the processing locally.",
      "support.faq.converter.q3": "What file formats do you support?",
      "support.faq.converter.a3": "We support all major image formats including JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP, BMP, TIFF, and more. New formats are added regularly as browser capabilities expand.",
      "support.faq.converter.q4": "Is there a file size limit?",
      "support.faq.converter.a4": "File size limits depend on your device's memory and browser capabilities. Most modern devices can handle images up to 50MB without issues.",
      "support.faq.converter.q5": "Why is my conversion taking a long time?",
      "support.faq.converter.a5": "Processing time depends on your device's power and the image size. Large files or older devices may take longer. Try closing other browser tabs to free up memory.",
      
      "support.faq.technical.title": "Technical Support",
      "support.faq.technical.q1": "The converter isn't working in my browser",
      "support.faq.technical.a1": "Our tool works best in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). Make sure you're using an updated version. If issues persist, try: clearing your browser cache, disabling browser extensions temporarily, or trying an incognito/private window.",
      "support.faq.technical.q2": "My converted image quality looks different",
      "support.faq.technical.a2": "We use advanced algorithms to maintain quality during conversion. Some format changes (like PNG to JPG) may affect transparency or compression. Choose your output format based on your specific needs.",
      "support.faq.technical.q3": "Can I convert multiple images at once?",
      "support.faq.technical.a3": "Yes! Our batch processing feature allows you to convert multiple images simultaneously. Select multiple files when uploading to save time.",
      
      "support.faq.privacy.title": "Privacy & Security",
      "support.faq.privacy.q1": "Are my images really private?",
      "support.faq.privacy.a1": "Absolutely. Since processing happens entirely in your browser, we never see, store, or have access to your files. This isn't just a policy - it's technically impossible for us to access your images.",
      "support.faq.privacy.q2": "Do you keep any data about my conversions?",
      "support.faq.privacy.a2": "No. We don't track what you convert, when you convert, or any details about your files. We only collect basic website analytics (like page views) to improve our service.",
      "support.faq.privacy.q3": "Is it safe to convert sensitive images?",
      "support.faq.privacy.a3": "Yes! Our client-side processing makes it one of the safest ways to convert images online. Your files never travel over the internet during conversion.",

      "support.faq.privacy.a2": "Non. Nous ne suivons pas ce que vous convertissez, quand vous convertissez, ou tout détail sur vos fichiers. Nous collectons seulement des analyses de base du site web (comme les vues de page) pour améliorer notre service.",
